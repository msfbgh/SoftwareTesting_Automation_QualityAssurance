<b>How do I approach designing software?</b>

When I design software, I follow the six phases that make up the software development life cycle. The software development life cycleis a process that aims to produce high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations. There are six phases that make up the software development life cycle (SDLC); planning and requirements analysis, defining requirements, designing the product architecture, building or developing the product, testing the product and deployment in the market and maintenance of the software. Testing is by far one of the most important stages of the SDLC. The role of testing is to reduce risk and improve quality by finding defects in the software product.
